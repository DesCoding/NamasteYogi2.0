# NamasteYogi

Notes about the project:

Objective: Create a yoga app that offers clients mini yoga breaks and breath reminders. Zen moments for the busy overwhelmed yogi.

User Story: NamasteYogi provides customizable Zen Moments where users will take time to be present, create focus and strength through hatha yoga postures, meditation, and breathing techniques.

NamasteYogi is for the yogi who has just a little too much on thier to do list.  Clients input problem areas or share how they are feeling, the app offers yoga postures, meditation, and/or breath work easily incorporated into each day.  

Postures:  Create arrays of poses that correlate with each body section/part.

Mediation:  Breath work (visual ques), relaxing music playlist.


API Options - 

Free music: https://www.last.fm/api/show/track.search

Good source for photos and backgrounds:  Motionarray.com


 youtube yoga with Adriene with timed flows and problem area focused flows:  https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene

Visual Setup:

Home page:  with welcome  message and buttons

Meditation page:  Music (free fm API) and center candle

Your Practice:  yoga studio search (yelp API) and possibly yoga videos if we have time

Upon opening the page, users will see a soothing background, lotus flower upon opening (fades out after 3 seconds) a heading that says.  "Welcome, Namaste Yogi.  Click below to choose your zen.".  Three buttons will be available on the home page.  User can choose either yoga poses, meditation, or my studio. 

When user clicks icon of poses, video pops up, user has an option to save favorite poses to "my studio".

Future Development Ideas:
Meditation
Anatomy Model w/ clickable body areas
Zen Moments could be categorized by body part - music, poses and meditation will be linked to an anatomy model (maybe) with buttons to correlate with all the date.
Essential Oil recommendations
Music playlists
Visual queues for breath
Anatomy graphics or clickable image for users to choose focus areas or symptoms. 

Next steps:

        Search textbox for zipcode/user input stored to local storage (find studio near me option)

        search textbox for poses and save to local storage (pose linked to youtube)

        
        fix repo issues (done)

        fix navbar issue (done)

        API details - format a placeholders for address for each yoga stuido response to go 

        format placeholders for yoga videos to go

        meditation screen center the youtube video

        on index, make sure buttons and fix the hamburger menu - add links to span.
