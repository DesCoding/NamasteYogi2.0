# NamasteYogi

Notes about the project:

Objective: Create a yoga app that offers clients mini yoga breaks and breath reminders. Zen moments for the busy overwhelmed yogi.

User Story: NamasteYogi provides customizable Zen Moments where users will take time to be present, create focus and strength through hatha yoga postures, meditation, and breathing techniques.

NamasteYogi is for the yogi who has just a little too much on thier to do list.  Clients input problem areas or share how they are feeling, the app offers yoga postures, meditation, and/or breath work easily incorporated into each day.  

Postures:  Create arrays of poses that correlate with each body section/part.

Mediation:  Breath work (visual ques), relaxing music playlist.

Anatomy Model w/ clickable body areas
Zen Moments could be categorized by body part - music, poses and meditation will be linked to an anatomy model (maybe) with buttons to correlate with all the date.
Essential Oil recommendations
Music playlists
Visual queues for breath
Anatomy graphics or clickable image for users to choose focus areas or symptoms.
